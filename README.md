## Problem statement

I have a program in an ETL pipeline written in Java, that processes ASUps also called auto support updates ( which are basically support updates from servers to the company) , it has a class/ file called AsupId generator in Java and it uses akka actors that basically do some Id generation for ASUPs, they take values from a kafka topic and then serializeand create the ASUP id with the info that comes it,
it generates an ID such that it has 16 numbers, where the first 12 numbers are the timestamp YYYYMMDDHHMM till the minute mark and the last four numbers is an incremental id from 0000 to 9999 , but the thing is sometimes there is a push of over 10k asups per minute, then this id generation will not work right ? , so we need to solve that. Though the occurrence of more than 10k asups happens only once in a while. The constraint is that the people who administer the Asups don't want to change the timestamp i.e. first 12 digits of the ASUP, but they don't mind if the minutes timestamp part of the id is changed by + or - 10 minutes max,
Also we want to make everything fault tolerant and want to add redundancy as it is a critical process and a lot of downstream programs use the ASUp Id that is generated here for their dat analysis etc tasks. I want to make sure if the instance that runs this goes down, there should be some redundancy. Also, we are considering if there is any benefit to using partitions in kafka and then splitting the task into 10 instances or is that too much complexity. Also another one of the actors publishes the Asup to another Kakfka topic, so what would be the best solution for this. So with this redesign I want to rewrite all the code in simple, easy to deploy, maintain and debug and read python.
